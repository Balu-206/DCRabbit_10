	interrupts.c

	This sample program is for the BL4S1xx series SBCs.

   Description:
	============
   This program demonstrates the use of the RIO interrupt service
   capabilities on the BL4S1xx series.  The demo sets up two interrupt
   sources, one is an external interrupt which will be tied to a push
   button switch, the other a rollover interrupt tied to a timer which
   is producing a PWM output.

   The STDIO window will show a count of rollovers that have occurred
   since the PWM signal was started.  The window will also display a
   message of 'Button Pressed' each time the push button switch is
   depressed.  The message will display for 1 second unless the button
   is pressed again.  Each time the button is pressed it will reset the
   timeout timer that removes the message, so you can keep the message
   on the screen indefinitely as long as you keep pressing the button
   in time.

	Connections:
	============
	1. DEMO board jumper settings:
			- Set switches to active low by setting JP15 2-4 and 3-5.

   2. Connect a wire from the controller GND, to the DEMO board GND.

   3. Connect a wire from the controller +5V to the DEMO board +V.

   4. Connect the following wires from the controller to the DEMO board:
	   	From IN0 to SW1

	Instructions:
	=============
   1. Compile and run this program.
   2. Observe the counter updating and press SW1 to see the 'Button Pressed'
      message
