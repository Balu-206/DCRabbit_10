	This sample program is for the BL4S1xx series SBCs.

	Description:
	============
   Reads and displays the current of all 4-20mA analog input
   channels. The voltage is calculated from coefficients read from
   the flash.


	Connections:
	============
   1. Place jumpers across pins 1-2 and 5-6 on headers J10 and J11.
   2. Connect a current meter in series as shown below with it set to
   read 4 to 20 milliamps of current.

	Instructions:
	=============
	1. Compile and run this program.
	2. Follow directions in STDIO window.
	3. Vary voltage (0-2.5v) on power supply to see the CURRENT meter track
	what's being displayed by Dynamic C (4-20ma).

	Note: For best results use a 4 1/2 digit current meter
