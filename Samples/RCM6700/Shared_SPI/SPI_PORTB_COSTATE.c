   SPI_PORTB_COSTATE.C

	Rabbit Semiconductor, 2010

	This sample program is for R6000 series controllers.

	Description
	===========
	This program demonstrates some cooperative multi-tasking techniques
   for using costatements with SPI device API functions when accessing
   multiple devices on the SPI port B.

   Instructions
   ============
   1. Compile and run program.
   2. Monitor STDIO output messages to see SPI Port B accesses
      by FAT, Serial Flash, and pseudo customer device.
