   reserved_read_write.c

   Sample program to read/write User block reserved area calibration constants.

   This program does not format the data, it merely reads the data into an
   array. It should be run on any board used for development with calibration
   constants so that restoring them, if necessary, will be easy.

   Instructions to read calibration constants from User block:
      1)  Run this program with no modifications       (e.g. F9)
      2)  Acknowledge the Program Terminated dialog    (e.g. Esc)
      3)  Put the Stdio window in focus                (e.g. Ctrl-Tab)
      4)  Highlight the Stdio window contents          (e.g. Ctrl-A)
      5)  Copy the contents to the clipboard           (e.g. Ctrl-C)
      6)  Put this program in focus                    (e.g. Ctrl-Shift-Tab)
      7)  Return to Edit mode                          (e.g. F4)
      8)  Highlight the current ub_array data at the
          "   0x000  // replace with ..." line, below
      9)  Replace with calibration constants data      (e.g. Ctrl-V)
      10) Uncomment #define UB_WRITE, below
      11) Copy this modified file to a safe place      (File | Save As...)

   Instructions to restore calibration constants to User block:
      1)  Retrieve the file saved in step 11 above
      2)  Run                                          (e.g. F9)
