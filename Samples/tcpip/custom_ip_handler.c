/**********************************************************************
 *		Samples\TCPIP\custom_ip_handler.c
 *
 *    This code demonstrates the CUSTOM_IP_HANDLER macro.
 *
 *    We'll be using CUSTOM_IP_HANDLER to preprocess IP packets before
 *    the TCP stack sees them.  We'll parse through the packet to read
 *    the port.  If the port matches one of our custom ports, and the
 *    socket is not currently in use (!sock_alive(&socket)), we'll set
 *    up a tcp_listen() call to accept the connection.
 *
 *    For more information on CUSTOM_IP_HANDLER, read the comment in
 *    IP.lib.
 *
 *    Most of the code in main() was leveraged from echo.c, a basic
 *    server, that when a client connect, echoes back to them any data
 *    that they send.
 *
