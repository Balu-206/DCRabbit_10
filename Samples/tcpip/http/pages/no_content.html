<title>Rabbit "No Content" Sample</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>
	This sample demonstrates use of the "204 No Content" HTTP/1.1 response.
	The HTTP/1.1 specification includes the following in its section (10.2.5)
	on the "204 No Content" response:
</p>
<p><blockquote>
		If the client is a user agent, it SHOULD NOT change its document view
		from that which caused the request to be sent. This response is primarily
		intended to allow input for actions to take place without causing a
		change to the user agent's active document view, although any new or
		updated metainformation SHOULD be applied to the document currently in
		the user agent's active view.
</blockquote></p>
<p>
	This makes the 204 response useful for a remote control interface, where
	the web browser page doesn't change, but the Rabbit device does something
	based on the command sent.
</p>
<p>
	In this sample, simple buttons simulate a remote control and just print
	the commands in the STDIO window.  By using the "204 No Content" response,
	the page does not reload/refresh.
