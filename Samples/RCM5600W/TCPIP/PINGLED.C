   pingled.c

	This program is used with RCM56xxW series controllers and interface board,
	and optionally with digital I/O accessory board, available with the
   deluxe dev kit.

   See "Add Additional Boards" in the User's Manual for instructions on
   how to attach the accessory board.

	Description
	===========
   This program demonstrates ICMP by pinging a remote host.
   If the interface board only is used, it will produce a long flash when a
   ping is sent and a short flash when a ping is received.
	If a digital I/O accessory board is used, its DS2 LED will flash when a
   ping is sent and its DS3 LED when a ping is sent and received.

	This program was adapted from \Samples\TCPIP\ping.c.

	Instructions
	============
   1. Change PING_WHO to the host you want to ping.

   2. You may modify the PING_DELAY define to change the
   	amount of time in milliseconds between the outgoing
   	pings.

   3. Uncomment the VERBOSE define to see the incoming
      ping replies.

	4. Compile and run this program.

	5. For the interface board of the standard kit:
       DS1 will go on with a brief toggle off when a ping is sent.
		 DS1 will go off for a longer duration when a ping is received.
      For the digital I/O accessory board of the deluxe dev kit:
       DS2 will flash when a ping is sent.
		 DS3 will flash when a ping is received.
