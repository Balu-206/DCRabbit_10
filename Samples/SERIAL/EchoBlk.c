     This program echos a block of characters over serial port D.
     It must be run with a serial utility such as Hyperterminal.

     Connect RS232 cable from PC to Rabbit:
     	 Connect PC's RS232 GND to Rabbit GND
       Connect PC's RS232 TD  to Rabbit RXD
       Connect PC's RS232 RD  to Rabbit TXD

     Configure the serial utility for port connected to RS232, 19200 8N1.

     Run this program.
     Run Hyperterminal.
     Type characters into the serial utility window.

     This program will echo a block of characters sent from the serial
     utility back to the serial utility where they will appear in its
     send/receive window. It reads bytes over serial port D into a data
     structure and writes back what it read as soon as the number of bytes
     defined by the length parameter is read or when it times out. The
     length parameter in this example is set to the size of the data
     structure into which the stream of serial data will be read. Each time
     a complete block is read the timeout clock stops. Once a new block
     begins, it will timeout if the byte to byte period elapses prior to
     completing the block.
