   pingled_wpa_psk.c
	Digi International, Copyright (C) 2007-2008.  All rights reserved.

	This program is used with BL5S220 controllers.

	Description
	===========
   This program is an extension of pingled.c.  It demonstrates use
   of WPA PSK (Wifi Protected Access with Pre-Shared Key).

   WPA is a more secure replacement for WEP.  This implementation
   supports use of TKIP (Temporal Key Integrity Protocol) cypher
   suite.

   Apart from the configuration of WPA PSK at the top of the sample,
   the rest of the code is identical to the case without WPA.
   Indeed, most of the TCP/IP samples should work with WPA PSK
   simply by using the same configuration settings.

   Connections:
	============

	****WARNING****: When using the J7 connector, be sure to insulate or cut
      the exposed wire from the wire leads you are not using.  The only
      connection required from J7 for any of the sample programs is +5v.

	1. DEMO board jumper settings:
			- Set LEDs to sinking by
            * removing all jumpers in JP3 and JP4
         	* setting all jumpers in JP1 and JP2

	2. Connect a wire from the controller J10 pin 5 GND to the DEMO board
	   J1 GND.

	3. Connect a wire from the controller J7 pin 6 (+5V) to the DEMO board +V.

   4. Connect the following wires from the controller J10 to the DEMO
      board screw terminal:

      From J10 pin 9 DIO0 to LED1
      From J10 pin 4 DIO1 to LED2

	Instructions
	============
	1. Configure your access point for WPA PSK.  Specify TKIP
	   cypher suite, and enter a suitable pre-shared key.  The key
	   may be entered as 64 hexadecimal digits, or an ascii string
	   of up to 63 characters.  Authentication should be set to
	   "open system", which basically means that knowledge of the
	   key is sufficient to allow access.

	   HINT: since the key is long, there is a good chance of
	   typos.  Hence, it is advisable to enter the key in this
	   sample first, then copy and paste into your access point.
	   This ensures that both the BL5S220 and the access point
	   have the same key!

	   HINT2: for an initial test, it may be easier to use the
	   64 hex digit form of the key rather than the ascii
	   passphrase.  A passphrase requires considerable computation
	   effort which delays the startup of the sample by about
	   40 seconds.

	   See the configuration section below for more details.

	   The following steps are much the same as in the basic
	   pingled.c sample...

   2. Change PING_WHO to the host you want to ping.

   3. You may modify the PING_DELAY define to change the
   	amount of time in milliseconds between the outgoing
   	pings.

   4. Uncomment the VERBOSE define to see the incoming
      ping replies.

	5. Compile and run this program.

	6. LED1 will flash when a ping is sent.
		LED2 will flash when a ping is received.
