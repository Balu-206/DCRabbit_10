	This sample program is for the BLxS2xx series controllers.

	Description:
	============
	This program demonstrates how to read an ADC milliamp channel using
	previously defined coefficients. It will also continuously display
	the current that is being monitored.


	Connections:
	============
   1. Set jumpers to connect pins 1-2, 3-4, 5-6, and 7-8 on JP4 for
   4-20 mA current measurements.
	2. Connect a current meter in series as shown below with it set to
   read 4 to 20 milliamps of current.

	Instructions:
	=============
	1. Compile and run this program.
	2. Follow the prompted directions of this program during execution.
	3. Vary voltage (0-2.5v) on power supply to see the CURRENT meter track
	what's being displayed by Dynamic C (4-20ma).

	Note: For best results use a 4 1/2 digit current meter
