	adc_rd_se_bipolar.c

	This sample program is for the BLxS2xx series controllers.

	Description:
	============
   Reads and displays the voltage of all single-ended analog input
   channels. The voltage is calculated from coefficients read from
   the reserved eeprom storage device.

   !!!Important!!! "Power supply outputs must be floating for the
                    following steps to be correct"

   Connections for bipolar mode of operation, +-10V
   ------------------------------------------------
   1. Remove all jumpers from JP4 for voltage measurements.
   2. Connect the positive power supply lead to an input ADC channel.
	3.	Connect the negative power supply lead to AGND on the controller.

   To obtain negative voltage values for the ADC to read, reverse the
   power leads as follows:
   1. Connect the negative power supply lead of to an input ADC channel.
	2.	Connect the positive power supply lead to AGND on the controller.

	Instructions:
	=============
	1. Compile and run this program.
	2. Follow the prompted directions of this program during execution.
	3. Voltage will be continuously displayed for all channels.
