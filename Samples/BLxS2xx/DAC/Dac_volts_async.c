   dac_volts_async.c

	This sample program is for the BLxS2xx series controllers.

   Description:
   ============
   This program outputs a voltage that can be read with a voltmeter.
   The output voltage is computed with using the calibration constants
   that are located in reserved eeprom.

   The DAC circuit is setup for Asynchronous mode of operation which
   will update the DAC output at the time it's being written via the
   anaOut or anaOutVolts functions.

	Instructions:
   =============
   1. Set jumpers to connect pins 1-3 and 2-4 on JP5 for voltage outputs
	2. Set jumpers to connect pins 1-2 and 3-4 on JP3 for channel 0 unipolar;
   	or, set jumper to connect pins 5-6 on JP3 for channel 0 bipolar
      NOTE: Set channel 0 & 1 to the same mode, both unipolar or both bipolar
	3. Set jumpers to connect pins 1-2 and 3-4 on JP6 for channel 1 unipolar;
		or, set jumper to connect pins 5-6 on JP6 for channel 1 bipolar
	4. Connect a voltmeter to one of the DAC output channels labeled
      AOUT0 - AOUT1 on PCB
	5. Compile and run this program
	6. Follow the prompted directions of this program during execution
