	master.c

	This sample program is for the BLxS2xx series controllers.

	Description:
	============
   This sample requires two units which each have an available
   RS485 serial port, one to use as slave, the other as master.

	This program demonstrates a simple RS485 transmission
	of lower case letters to the slave controller.  The slave
	will send converted upper case letters back to the master
	controller and these will be displayed in the STDIO window.

   Stopping and re-starting this program once the controllers are
   communicating may cause an error on the read back of the
   character which was interrupted.

	Use the 'slave.c' sample to program the slave controller first,
   then disconnect the programming cable and run this program on
   the master controller.  The RS485 ports must be connected
   together as shown below.

	Connections:
	============
		Master to  Slave
		485+ <---> 485+
		485- <---> 485-
		GND  <---> GND

	On BLxS2xx series boards:
	   485+ pin 9 on J11
	   485- pin 4 on J11
	   GND  pin 5 on J11

	Instructions:
	=============
	1. Connect the two boards as shown under connections.
   2. Compile and run the 'slave.c' sample program on one board.
   2. Disconnect programming cable and move to the other board.
   2. Compile and run this program.
 	2. View STDIO window for sample program results.
