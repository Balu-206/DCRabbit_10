	Simple3wire.c

	This program is used with BLxS2xx series controllers, except
   the BL4S210 (see below).

	Description:
	============
	This program demonstrates basic initialization for a
	simple RS232 3-wire loopback displayed in STDIO window.

   The BL4S210 board does not have two 3-wire serial ports and
   is not supported by this sample. This sample applies to all
   other BLxS2xx series controllers.

   Here's the typical connections for a 3 wire interface that
   would be made between controllers.

       TX <---> RX
       RX <---> TX
		Gnd <---> Gnd

	Connections:
	============
	1. Connect TXE (pin 1) to RXF (pin 7) located on J11.
   2. Connect TXF (pin 2) to RXE (pin 6) located on J11.

	Instructions:
	=============
	1. Compile and run this program.
 	2. View STDIO window for sample program results.
