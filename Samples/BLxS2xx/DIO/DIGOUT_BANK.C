	This sample program is for the BLxS2xx series controllers.

   Description:
	============
	This program demonstrates using the digOutBank API function to
   control digital sinking type outputs to toggle LED's ON and OFF
   on the demo board provided with your kit.  The banking functions
   allow banks of IO to be input or output more efficiently.

	Connections:
	============

	****WARNING****: When using the J7 connector, be sure to insulate or cut
      the exposed wire from the wire leads you are not using.  The only
      connection required from J7 for any of the sample programs is +5v.

	1. DEMO board jumper settings:
			- Set LEDs to sinking by
            * removing all jumpers in JP3 and JP4
         	* setting all jumpers in JP1 and JP2

	2. Connect a wire from the controller J10 pin 5 GND to the DEMO board GND.

	3. Connect a wire from the controller J7 pin 6 (+5V) to the DEMO board +V.

   4. Connect the following wires from the controller J10 to the demo
	    board screw terminals:

	   	From DIO0 to LED1
	   	From DIO1 to LED2
	   	From DIO2 to LED3
	   	From DIO3 to LED4

	Instructions:
	=============
	1. Compile and run this program.

	2. Select an output channel via the STDIO window (per the channels you
      connected to the LED's) to toggle a LED on the demo board.
      NOTE: Since the configurable outputs use sinking drivers, they are
            enabled (and the LED will light) when the port is at logic 0.

	3. To check other outputs that are not connected to the demo board,
      you can use a voltmeter to see the output change states or change
      the wiring to connect other outputs to a LED.
