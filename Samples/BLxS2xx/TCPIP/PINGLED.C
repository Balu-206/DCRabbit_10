   pingled.c
	Digi International, Copyright (C) 2007-2008.  All rights reserved.

	This program is used with BLxS2xx series controllers.

	Description
	===========
   This program demonstrates ICMP by pinging a remote host.
	It will flash LEDs on an attached demo board when a ping
	is sent and received.

	This program was adapted from \Samples\TCPIP\ping.c.

   Connections:
	============

	****WARNING****: When using the J7 connector, be sure to insulate or cut
      the exposed wire from the wire leads you are not using.  The only
      connection required from J7 for any of the sample programs is +5v.

	1. DEMO board jumper settings:
			- Set LEDs to sinking by
            * removing all jumpers in JP3 and JP4
         	* setting all jumpers in JP1 and JP2

	2. Connect a wire from the controller J10 pin 5 GND to the DEMO board
	   J1 GND.

	3. Connect a wire from the controller J7 pin 6 (+5V) to the DEMO board +V.

   4. Connect the following wires from the controller J10 to the DEMO
      board screw terminal:

      From J10 pin 9 DIO0 to LED1
      From J10 pin 4 DIO1 to LED2

	Instructions
	============
   1. Change PING_WHO to the host you want to ping.

   2. You may modify the PING_DELAY define to change the
   	amount of time in milliseconds between the outgoing
   	pings.

   3. Uncomment the VERBOSE define to see the incoming
      ping replies.

	4. Compile and run this program.

	5. LED1 will flash when a ping is sent.
		LED2 will flash when a ping is received.
