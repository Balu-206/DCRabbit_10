   Samples\Rabbit4000\pwm_test.c

   Description
   ===========
   This program demonstrates the PWM functions of the Rabbit 4000
   processor.

   It will set the four PWM channels, port E bits 4 - 7, to the
   following values:

	Option 1:
   (PC4) Channel 0:  10% duty cycle
   (PC5) Channel 1:  25% duty cycle

	Option 2:
   (PE4) Channel 0:  10% duty cycle
   (PE5) Channel 1:  25% duty cycle
   (PE6) Channel 2:  50% duty cycle
   (PE7) Channel 3:  99% duty cycle

   Parallel ports C and D are also available.  To use them, change
   PWM_USEPORTE to the appropriate port. Note: C6 and C7 are shared
   between PWM and serial port A used for communication with Dynamic C.

   Pulse spreading can be turned on or off PWM_SPREAD below.
   See documentation for pwm_set() for details.

   Instructions
   ============
   1. Compile and run this program.
   2. Best way to view duty cycles is to observe each channel
      with an oscilloscope.
