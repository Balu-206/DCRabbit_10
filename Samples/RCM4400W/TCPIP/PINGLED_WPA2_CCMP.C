   pingled_wpa2_ccmp.c

	This program is used with RCM4400W series controllers
	with prototyping boards.

	Description
	===========
   This program is an extension of pingled.c.  It demonstrates use
   of WPA2 PSK (Wifi Protected Access with Pre-Shared Key).

   WPA2 is a more secure replacement for WEP.  This implementation
   uses the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) based algorithm, also known
   as CCMP (Counter Mode with Cipher Block Chaining Message Authentication
   Code Protocol) cypher suite.

   Apart from the configuration of WPA2_CCMP at the top of the sample,
   the rest of the code is identical to the case without WPA2 PSK.
   Indeed, most of the TCP/IP samples should work with WPA2 CCMP
   simply by using the same configuration settings.

	Instructions
	============
	1. Configure your access point for WPA2 PSK.  Specify CCMP
	   cypher suite, and enter a suitable pre-shared key.  The key
	   may be entered as 64 hexadecimal digits, or an ascii string
	   of up to 63 characters.  Authentication should be set to
	   "open system", which basically means that knowledge of the
	   key is sufficient to allow access.

	   HINT: since the key is long, there is a good chance of
	   typos.  Hence, it is advisable to enter the key in this
	   sample first, then copy and paste into your access point.
	   This ensures that both the RCM4400W and the access point
	   have the same key!

	   HINT2: for an initial test, it may be easier to use the
	   64 hex digit form of the key rather than the ascii
	   passphrase.  A passphrase requires considerable computation
	   effort which delays the startup of the sample by about
	   40 seconds.

	   See the configuration section below for more details.

	   The following steps are much the same as in the basic
	   pingled.c sample...

   2. Change PING_WHO to the host you want to ping.

   3. You may modify the PING_DELAY define to change the
   	amount of time in milliseconds between the outgoing
   	pings.

   4. Uncomment the VERBOSE define to see the incoming
      ping replies.

	5. Compile and run this program.

	6. DS2 will flash when a ping is sent.
		DS3 will flash when a ping is received.
