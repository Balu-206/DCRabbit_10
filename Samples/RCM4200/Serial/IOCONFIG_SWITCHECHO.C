	This program is used with RCM4200 series controllers and prototyping boards.


	Description
	===========

	This program transmits and then receives an ASCII string on either serial
	port E (self-echo, RCM4210 only) or on serial port D (self-echo) when the S2
	or S3 switch, respectively, is pressed. It also displays the echoed serial
	data echoed via either serial port E (RCM4210 only) or port D in the STDIO
	window.

	Note that the I/O lines that carry serial port E signals are not the Rabbit
	4000 CPU defaults, and even these lines are not available on the RCM4200 due
	to their alternate use as analog inputs.  The serial ports D and E (RCM4210
	only) I/O lines are configured by calling a library function, serDEconfig(),
	that was generated by the Rabbit 4000 IOCONFIG.EXE utility program.  Note
	that the serDopen() and serEopen() (RCM4210 only) function calls are made
	within the generated library code.

	Serial port D is left in its default configuration, using parallel port C
	bits PC1 and PC0.  These signals are available on the prototyping board's
	RS232 connector.

	Serial port E (RCM4210 only) is configured to use parallel port D bits PD7
	and PD6.  These signals are available on the prototyping board's Module
	Extension Header.

	Also note that there are two IOCONFIG.EXE generated libraries.  One library
	is for the 29 MHz RCM4210 and the other is for the 58 MHz RCM4200.


	Prototyping Board Connections
	=============================

	For serial port E (RCM4210 only), on the Module Extension Header connect a
	wire jumper between the pins marked PD7 and PD6.

	For serial port D, on the RS232 connector place a wire jumper between the
	pins marked RXD and TXD.


	Instructions
	============

	1. Compile and run this program.
	2. Press and release S2 or S3, as desired, on the prototyping board.
	3. View data echoed via the respective serial port(s) in the STDIO window.
