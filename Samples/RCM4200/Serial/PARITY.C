	Rabbit Semiconductor, 2006

	This program is used with RCM4200 series controllers
	and prototyping boards.

	Description
	===========
	This program demonstrates use of parity modes by repeatedly
	sending byte values 0-127 from TXC (serial port C) to RXD
   (serial port D).
	The program will cycle through parity types on serial port
	C. Serial port D will always be checking for odd parity, so
	parity errors should occur during most sequences.

	Prototyping Board Connections
	=============================

		On the RS232 connector
		-----------------------------

		 TXC <-------> RXD


	Instructions
	============
	1.  Run this program and observe error sequence in STDIO.
