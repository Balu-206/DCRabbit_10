	parity.c

	This program is used with RCM4000 series controllers
	and prototyping boards.

	Description
	===========
	This program demonstrates use of parity modes by repeatedly
	sending byte values 0-127 from TXC (serial port C) to RXD
   (serial port D).
	The program will switch between parity types on serial port
	C. Serial port D will always be checking parity, so parity
	errors should occur during every other sequence.

	Prototyping Board Connections
	=============================

		On the RS232 connector
		-----------------------------

		 TXC <-------> RXD


	Instructions
	============
	1.  Run this program and observe error sequence in STDIO.
