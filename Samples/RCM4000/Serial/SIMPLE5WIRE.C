	simple5wire.c

	This program is used with RCM4000 series controllers and
	prototyping boards.

	Description
	===========
	This program demonstrates basic initialization for a
	simple RS232 5-wire loopback displayed in STDIO window.

	Normally we would connect to another controller,

		 Tx <---> Rx
		RTS <---> CTS
		Gnd <---> Gnd

	RTS and CTS can be most any parallel port pin if properly
	configured. However, for this simple demonstration, make
	the following connections:

	Proto-board Connections
	=======================

			TxD <---> RxD
	(RTS)	TxC <---> RxC (CTS)

	Instructions
	============
	1.  Compile and run this program.
	2.  TxC and RxC become the flow control RTS and CTS.
	3.  To test flow control, disconnect RTS from CTS while
		 running	this program.  Characters should stop printing
		 in STDIO window and continue when RTS and CTS are
		 connected again.
