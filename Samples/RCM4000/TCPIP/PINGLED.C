   pingled.c
   Rabbit Semiconductor, 2006

	This program is used with RCM400 series controllers
	with prototyping boards.

	Description
	===========
   This program demonstrates ICMP by pinging a remote host.
	It will flash LED's, DS2 and DS3 on the prototyping
	board when a ping is sent and received.

	This program was adapted from \Samples\TCPIP\ping.c.

	Instructions
	============
   1. Change PING_WHO to the host you want to ping.

   2. You may modify the PING_DELAY define to change the
   	amount of time in milliseconds between the outgoing
   	pings.

   3. Uncomment the VERBOSE define to see the incoming
      ping replies.

	4. Compile and run this program.

	5. DS2 will flash when a ping is sent.
		DS3 will flash when a ping is received.


	Quick test with two RCM4000 controllers
	======================================
	1.	Connect a cross-over cable to each controller.
	2. Change #define TCPCONFIG 0.
	3. Uncomment #define MY_IP_ADDRESS and #define PING_WHO.
	4. Compile and run this program on one controller.
	5. Switch the value of MY_IP_ADDRESS and PING_WHO.
	6. Compile and run this program on the second controller.
	7. On each board:
		DS2 will flash when a ping is sent.
		DS3 will flash when a ping is received.
