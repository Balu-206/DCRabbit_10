	flowcontrol.c
	Rabbit Semiconductor, 2007

	This program is used with RCM4500W series controllers
	and prototyping boards.

	Description
	===========
	This program demonstrates hardware flow control by sending a
	pattern of '*' characters out of TXC (serial port C) at
	115200 baud.

	One character at a time is received on RXC and is displayed.
	In this example RXD is configured as the CTS input, detecting
	a clear to send condition, and TXD is configured as the RTS
	output, signaling a ready condition. This demonstration can be
	performed with either one or two core module boards.

	Refer to the function description for serCflowcontrolOn()
	for a general description on how to set up flow control lines.
	(place cursor on function name and press CTRL+H)

	Prototyping Board Connections
	=============================

	On the RS232 connector, one or two boards
	-----------------------------------------

	   (CTS) RXD <-------> TXD (RTS)
	         RXC <-------> TXC
	         GND <-------> GND (two boards only)


	Instructions
	============
	1.	With two boards, run the program on the sending board and then
		disconnect and power it back up so that the program is running
		in stand-alone mode.
		Connect to the second board, which will be the receiver and
		run this same program normally.

	2.	A repeating triangular pattern should print out in
		the STDIO window. The program will periodically switch flow
		control on or off to	demonstrate the effect of no flow control
		for a very slow receiver.

	3.	You can also observe the signals with a scope to see flow
		control operating.
