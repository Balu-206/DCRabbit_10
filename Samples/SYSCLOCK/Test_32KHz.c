   This program demonstrates the Rabbit 4000 and 5000 CPUs' ability to run off
   the 32kHz oscillator divided by various values.

   This program is not intended for use with the Rabbit 6000 CPU, which Dynamic
   C defaults to using a PLL-based main clock.  For details, please refer to the
   Rabbit 6000 Microprocessor User's manual, section "2 Clocks" and especially
   to subsections "2.1 Overview" and "2.3.5 32 kHz Clock."

   This program will blink LEDs at a fixed rate for different oscillator
   settings.  The following processor clock rates are demonstrated:
      - full processor clock
      - 32kHz oscillator
      - 32kHz oscillator divided by two
      - 32kHz oscillator divided by four
      - 32kHz oscillator divided by eight
      - 32kHz oscillator divided by sixteen
      - back to full processor clock

   Dynamic C will lose communication with the target in debug mode when the
   program switches from full processor clock mode.  To avoid this, compile
   without running (F5) and then use run with no polling (alt-F9).

   Running with the 32kHz oscillator also disables the periodic interrupt.  If
   your program depends on that interrupt (i.e. uses TICK_TIMER, MS_TIMER,
   SEC_TIMER, of waitfor statements in costates), then periodically update those
   counters by calling updateTimers() within your code.

   Note also that since the periodic interrupt is disabled while running off the
   32 KHz oscillator, the watchdog timer is disabled by first calling the
   Disable_HW_WDT() function.  An alternative is to call hitwd() periodically to
   ensure that the Rabbit CPU's hardware watchdog timer does not expire.

   As written, this program will blink LEDs on the prototyping board for RCM4xxx
   and RCM54xxW core modules, the single LED on the interface board for the
   RCM56xxW/RCM57xx core modules and the Ethernet activity LED on the BL4S1xx
   SBCs.

   To add blinky-LED support for other Rabbit targets, edit this sample to alter
   the BLINKYLEDS_* macro definitions as appropriate for available LEDs on the
   "other" target board.  It may also be necessary to add "#use <library name>"
   for some "other" boards.
