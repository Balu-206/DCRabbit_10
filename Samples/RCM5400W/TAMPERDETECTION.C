	TamperDetection.C

	This sample is designed for the RCM5400W series and prototyping boards.

   Tamper Detection detects any attempt to enter bootstrap mode.  When this
   is detected, the VBAT RAM is erased.  This can be useful for storing data
   from a remote location such as an AES encryption key.

   This sample shows how to load and read the VBAT RAM as well as enabling a
   visual indicator for detection.

	INSTRUCTIONS:

	1. Compile and run this sample.
   2. Remove the programming cable and reset the board.
   3. Press switch 2 to load the VBAT RAM with the key.  This changes the LED's
      to solid state.  Notice that reseting the board does not change this.
   4. Plug in the programming cable briefly and unplug it again. Now the LED's
      are flashing because the VBAT RAM has been erased. Notice that reseting
      the board does not change this.
   5. Feel free to repeat steps 3 and 4.

   NOTE:
   -----
   Actual recommended use of this feature would not store the 'key' in the
   flash, but retrieve it from a remote connection during runtime.
