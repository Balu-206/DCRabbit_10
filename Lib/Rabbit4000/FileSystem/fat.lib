FAT.LIB

Legacy FAT Filesystem supporting FAT12 & FAT16 has been depricated and
replaced by the FAT16 library.  For most core modules, the underlying format
of FAT16 partitions has not changed.  FAT12 partitions are no longer supported.
The only cores that require reformatting and possible migration of data are
the RCM4000 and RCM4050, which both have on board NAND flash.  The flash is
now accessed through a new flash translation library which requires the flash
to be reformatted before first use with FAT16 library.  If you have data that
must be moved before formatting, you can define FAT_NF_DIRECT to allow FAT16
to access a FAT.lib formatted NAND device in read only mode.  Use the
ftp_fat.c sample to create a simple FTP server which you can connect to and
download any files from the NAND flash before reformatting for use with the
FAT16 library.
