/* START FUNCTION DESCRIPTION ********************************************
setjmp                                                          <setjmp.h>

SYNTAX: int setjmp(jmp_buf env);

KEYWORDS:

DESCRIPTION: Store the PC (program counter), SP (stack pointer) and other
information about the current state into env.  The saved information can
be restored by executing longjmp. NOTE: you cannot use set/longjmp to
move out of slice statements, costatements, or cofunctions.

Typical usage:

switch (setjmp(e)) {
	case 0:
		// first time
		f();     // try to execute f, which may eventually call longjmp
		break;   // if we get here, f() was successful
	case 1:
		// if we get to here f() must have called longjmp
		// do exception handling
		break;
	case 2:
		// similar to above, just a different exception code.
		...
}

f() {
	g()
	...
}

g(){
	...
	longjmp(e,2);     // exception code 2
							// jump back to setjmp statement,
							// but causes setjmp to return 2, and
							// therefore execute case 2 in the switch
							// statement
}

PARAMETER1: information about the current state

RETURN VALUE: Returns zero if it is executed.  After longjmp is executed,
the program counter, stack pointer and etc. are restored to the state
when setjmp was executed the first time.  However, this time setjmp returns
whatever value is specifed by the longjmp statement.

;  SETJMP.CC
;
;  Purpose:
;
;    SETJMP saves its stack environment in array env[] for possible
;    later use by LONGJMP. It returns the value 0.
;
;    LONGJMP restores the stack environment saved in array env[].
;    The only confusing issue is how the return is made, and the effect
;    on the registers.
;
;          LONGJMP RETURN:  HL=VAL
;                           AF,BC,DE clobbered
;                           PC=address after the CALL SETJMP
;                              that created the data in env[].
;                           SP=env[0] - same as set by SETJMP
;
;    The use of SETJMP is not dangerous, since all it does is save
;    values. LONGJMP may be a problem if SETJMP is called recursively.
