/* START LIBRARY DESCRIPTION *********************************************

DESCRIPTION: 	This library is a stub to choose the pre-Rabbit 6000,
					bit-banged I2C support library ( I2C_SW.LIB ), or the support
               library for the on-chip I2C support library ( I2C_HW.LIB ).

               I2C_SW.LIB was formerly named I2C.LIB, and documentation
               may still refer to this library by the old name.
