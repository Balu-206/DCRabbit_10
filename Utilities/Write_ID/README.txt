The programs in this directory were designed to restore or modify the
System ID Block stored in the flash of Rabbit core modules and single-board
computers.  The ID block helps to identify the hardware configuration,
and includes manufacturing information like networking MAC addresses
and calibration data.

Please carefully read through the programs and follow instructions before
running any of them.  If used incorrectly, you can corrupt the System ID
Block to the point where the board is unusable.  It's also possible to
erase important calibration data stored during manufacturing.

If you are unsure about running any of these programs, please contact
Digi International's Technical Support department with your questions.
